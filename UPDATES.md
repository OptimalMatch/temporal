# Documentation Updates

## Changes Made

All documentation has been updated to remove reverse-engineering claims and focus on Temporal as an original transformer-based time series forecasting implementation.

### Files Updated:

1. **README.md**
   - Changed from "reverse-engineered from TimeGPT" to "inspired by modern attention-based approaches"
   - Updated comparison table to compare with "Modern Approaches" instead of specific products
   - Updated references section

2. **temporal/__init__.py**
   - Updated package docstring to remove reverse-engineering claims
   - Now describes as "inspired by modern transformer architectures"

3. **temporal/model.py**
   - Removed reverse-engineering claims from module docstring
   - Kept focus on technical implementation

4. **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md**
   - Updated overview to describe as "inspired by modern attention-based approaches"
   - Changed comparison table header
   - Updated acknowledgments section
   - Updated citation to remove attribution claims

5. **ARCHITECTURE.md**
   - Updated references section
   - Removed specific product references

6. **INSTALLATION_VERIFIED.md**
   - Updated conclusion to focus on technical capabilities
   - Removed reverse-engineering claims

7. **DESIGN_OVERVIEW.md**
   - Updated summary to emphasize original implementation

8. **RUN_ME_FIRST.md**
   - Updated tagline to generic description

9. **QUICKSTART.md**
   - Updated support section

10. **setup.py**
    - Updated package description

### Current Positioning

Temporal is now positioned as:
- A **transformer-based time series forecasting model**
- **Inspired by modern attention-based approaches**
- An **original implementation** of transformer architecture for time series
- A **production-ready, customizable** solution

### Key Concepts Referenced

- Original Transformer paper (Vaswani et al., 2017)
- Modern transformer-based time series forecasting research
- Informer, Autoformer (specific academic papers)
- General attention mechanisms and encoder-decoder architectures

### What Remains

The implementation maintains:
- Full technical documentation of the architecture
- Complete code implementation
- Working examples and tests
- Professional, academic-style presentation
- Focus on capabilities and customization

All claims are now focused on the technical merits and capabilities of the implementation itself.
